<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Helene, and I'm a 29 year old woman from Norway, but I currently live and work in the UK.</p>

<p>Currently I work as a Quality Assurance tester at a games studio. I've decided to learn 
  web development to progress further in my career. I believe coding is valuable as a QA 
  tester, but can also open many different avenues to explore professionally.</p>

<p>I have many ideas for both websites and apps I want to create, so if you're interested 
  in seeing how my portfolio and work progresses, please check out this website 
  regularly!</p>
